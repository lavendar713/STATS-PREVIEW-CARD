## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt the use of the mix-blend-one to add a sort of color overlay on a photo. 

Also learnt more on the "rem" unit of measurement. And how most browsers set the font-size of the html element to 16px. Making use of the 62.5% rule one could change the font size of html to 10px and thus using 10 to divide whatever value one wants to attain the right rem value.

### Continued development

I'll have to use the "rem" value more consistently so as to get a better understanding of it because i believe it's much more resourceful to use compare to the "px" unit.
